abstract = {The interaction between two conjugated molecules with overlapping p orbitals is described in terms of the ?r electrons of the separate systems. New (intermolecular) orbitals are built out of the interacting molecular orbitals. The interaction energy is expanded in terms of the small overlap S, and analytical energy expressions are obtained in terms of S+ between pairs of atoms r, r' and of an interaction integral q.,,. For molecules in their ground state, the total energy of interaction is the sum of a repulsion energy due to the ''exclusion shell " around each carbon atom and an attractive energy due to the mixing between occupied orbitals on one molecule and un-occupied orbitals on the other. Both of these terms are second order in the overlap. If one molecule is excited, an additional, first-order energy arises from the stabilization of the excited electron and'the destabilization of the hole. The general principle is established that a thermal reaction A + B is favored if there is strong interaction between the top occupied orbital(s) on one molecule and the lowest unoccupied orbital(s) on the other (and con-versely). On the other hand, a photochemical reaction A* + B is favored if the orbital of the excited electron (generally the lowest previously unoccupied orbital of A) interacts strongly with an orbital of neighboring or slightly higher energy (generally the lowest unoccupied orbital of B), equally, if the orbital of the hole (top occupied orbi-tal of A) interacts strongly with an orbital of neighboring or slightly lower energy (generally the top occupied orbi-tal of B). he study of the interaction between conjugated},
