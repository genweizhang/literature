abstract = {Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death critical for the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. A key event within the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis is the permeabilisation of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), a point of no return in apoptotic progression. This event is governed by a complex interplay of interactions between BCL-2 family members. Here we discuss the roles of opposing factions within the family. We focus on the structural details of these interactions, how they promote or prevent apoptosis and recent developments towards understanding the conformational changes of BAK and BAX that lead to MOM permeabilisation. These interactions and structural insights are of particular interest for drug discovery, as highlighted by the development of therapeutics that target pro-survival family members and restore apoptosis in cancer cells.},

abstract = {In normal circumstances, the Bcl-2 family dutifully governs when cells die. However, the rules of engagement between the pro- and antiapoptotic family members are still contested, and how Bax is transformed from a cytosolic monomer to an outer mitochondrial membrane-permeabilizing oligomer is unclear. With fluorescence techniques and an in vitro system, the combination of tBid and Bax produced dramatic membrane permeabilization. The membrane is not a passive partner in this process beause membranes are required for the protein-protein interactions to occur. Simultaneous measurements of these interactions revealed an ordered series of steps required for outer membrane permeabilization: (1) tBid rapidly binds to membranes, where (2) tBid interacts with Bax, causing (3) Bax insertion into membranes and (4) oligomerization, culminating in (5) membrane permeabilization. Bcl-XL prevents membrane-bound tBid from binding Bax. Bad releases tBid from Bcl-XL, restoring both tBid binding to Bax and membrane permeabilization. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Certain BH3-only relatives can directly activate them to mediate this pivotal, poorly understood step. To clarify the conformational changes that induce Bax oligomerization, we determined crystal structures of Bax$\Delta$C21 treated with detergents and BH3 peptides. The peptides bound the Bax canonical surface groove but, unlike their complexes with prosurvival relatives, dissociated Bax into two domains. The structures define the sequence signature of activator BH3 domains and reveal how they can activate Bax via its groove by favoring release of its BH3 domain. Furthermore, Bax helices $\alpha$2-$\alpha$5 alone adopted a symmetric homodimer structure, supporting the proposal that two Bax molecules insert their BH3 domain into each other's surface groove to nucleate oligomerization. A planar lipophilic surface on this homodimer may engage the membrane. Our results thus define critical Bax transitions toward apoptosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are key regulators of the apoptotic process. This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2-selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h. These data indicate that selective pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2 shows promise for the treatment of BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers.},

abstract = {Overexpression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) is commonly associated with tumor maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance. We previously reported the discovery of ABT-737, a potent, small-molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. A major limitation of ABT-737 is that it is not orally bioavailable, which would limit chronic single agent therapy and flexibility to dose in combination regimens. Here we report the biological properties of ABT-263, a potent, orally bioavailable Bad-like BH3 mimetic (K(i)'s of {\textless}1 nmol/L for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w). The oral bioavailability of ABT-263 in preclinical animal models is 20{\%} to 50{\%}, depending on formulation. ABT-263 disrupts Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interactions with pro-death proteins (e.g., Bim), leading to the initiation of apoptosis within 2 hours posttreatment. In human tumor cells, ABT-263 induces Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis. Oral administration of ABT-263 alone induces complete tumor regressions in xenograft models of small-cell lung cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma where ABT-263 exhibits modest or no single agent activity, it significantly enhances the efficacy of clinically relevant therapeutic regimens. These data provide the rationale for clinical trials evaluating ABT-263 in small-cell lung cancer and B-cell malignancies. The oral efficacy of ABT-263 should provide dosing flexibility to maximize clinical utility both as a single agent and in combination regimens.},

On cell stress Bax and Bak accumulate at distinct foci on the mitochondrial surface where they undergo a conformational change, oligomerize, and mediate cytochrome c release, leading to cell death.

Recent structural and biophysical studies at several length scales have shed light on key aspects of Bax and Bak function that have shifted how we think this process occurs. These discoveries reveal an unexpected molecular mechanism in which Bax (and likely Bak) dimers assemble into oligomers with an even number of molecules that fully or partially delineate pores of different sizes to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) during apoptosis.},

We report the NMR solution structure of the human BID BH3-BAK complex, which identified the activation site at the canonical BH3-binding groove of BAK. Mutating the BAK BH1 in the groove prevented activation and MOMP but not the binding of BID. BAK BH3 mutations allowed BID binding and activation but blunted function by blocking BAK oligomerization. BAK activation follows a 'hit-and-run' mechanism whereby BID dissociates from the trigger site, which allows BAK oligomerization at an overlapping interface. In contrast, the BH3-only proteins NOXA and BAD are predicted to clash with the trigger site and are not activators of BAK. These findings provide insights into the early stages of BAK activation.},

Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement.

A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based screening and structure-based drug design has yielded the first bona fide BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics, including the BCL-2 and BCL-XL dual antagonist navitoclax, which is the first BCL-2 family inhibitor to show efficacy in patients with cancer. Clinical experience with navitoclax prompted the generation of the highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, which is now approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior therapy. Recent advances have also been made in the development of potent and selective inhibitors of BCL-XL and myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1), which are additional BCL-2 family members with established anti-apoptotic roles in cancer. Here we review the latest progress in direct and selective targeting of BCL-2 family proteins for cancer therapy.},

@article{Peng2006,
abstract = {During initiation of apoptosis, Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane. BH3-only protein, tBid, activates pro-apoptotic Bax to release cytochrome c from mitochondria. tBid also activates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial outer membrane, changing it from a single-spanning to a multispanning conformation that binds the active Bax and inhibits cytochrome c release. However, it is not known whether other mitochondrial proteins are required to elicit the tBid-induced Bcl-2 conformational alteration. To define the minimal components that are required for the functionally important Bcl-2 conformational alteration, we reconstituted the reaction using purified proteins and liposomes. We found that purified tBid was sufficient to induce a conformational alteration in the liposome-tethered, but not cytosolic Bcl-2, resulting in a multispanning form that is similar to the one found in the mitochondrial outer membrane of drug-treated cells. Mutations that abolished tBid/Bcl-2 interaction also abolished the conformational alteration, demonstrating that a direct tBid/Bcl-2 interaction at the membrane is both required and sufficient to elicit the conformational alteration. Furthermore, active Bax also elicited the Bcl-2 conformational alteration. Bcl-2 mutants that displayed increased or decreased activity in the conformational alteration assay showed corresponding activities in inhibiting pore formation by Bax in vitro and in preventing apoptosis in vivo. Thus, there is a strong correlation between the direct interaction of membrane-bound Bcl-2 and tBid with activation of Bcl-2 in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {Interactions of Bcl-2 family proteins regulate permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane and apoptosis. In particular, Bax forms an oligomer that permeabilizes the membrane. To map the interface of the Bax oligomer we used Triton X-100 as a membrane surrogate and performed site-specific photocross-linking. Bax-specific adducts were formed through photo-reactive probes at multiple sites that can be grouped into two surfaces. The first surface overlaps with the BH1-3 groove formed by Bcl-2 Homology motif 1, 2, and 3; the second surface is a rear pocket located on the opposite side of the protein from the BH1-3 groove. Further cross-linking experiments using Bax BH3 peptides and mutants demonstrated that the two surfaces interact with their counterparts in neighboring proteins to form two separated interfaces and that interaction at the BH1-3 groove primes the rear pocket for further interaction. Therefore, Bax oligomerization proceeds through a series of interactions that occur at separate, yet allosterically, coupled interfaces.},

@article{Hunter2018,
abstract = {A convergent approach for the stereoselective synthesis of diverse spiroethers is described. The reaction involves stereoselective trapping of diazo-derived rhodium carbenoids with gold-activated alkynols for the installation of spiro cores. The reaction has proven general with a range of readily accessible homopropargylic alcohols and diazo carbon-yls to provide functionalized spiroether cores of bioactive scaffolds such as spirobarbiturates, spirooxindoles, and pseurotin natural products. ■ INTRODUCTION The spiroether core is found in a wide range of bioactive natural products and drug molecules (Figure 1). 1 Examples include the naturally occurring pseurotins, and spirooxindoles, both natural and synthetic. 2 Griseofulvin, a spiroether drug, is on the World Health Organization list of essential medicines. 3 The importance of this scaffold in drug development can be attributed to the spiro center inducing rigid organization of the overall molecular scaffold, causing the functional groups to be presented to biological targets in well-defined three-dimen-sional orientations to provide increased binding affinity and bioavailability. 4 Due to the biological and therapeutic values, the synthesis of spiroethers remains an area of current interest to the chemical community. 5 The key synthetic challenge is the stereoselective installation of the spiro center. Most methods rely heavily on intramolecular cyclization/rearrangement reactions of an appropriate linear precursor, which requires multiple synthetic steps for preparation (Figure 2a). 6 To overcome this synthetic challenge, we report a convergent approach for the stereoselective synthesis of diverse Figure 1. Examples of spiroether natural products and drug molecules. Figure 2. (a) Approaches for spiroether synthesis. (b) This work. Article pubs.acs.org/joc spiroethers through stereoselective trapping of rhodium carbenoids 7 with gold-activated homopropargylic alcohols (Figure 2b). Notably, this approach enables new Conia-ene cyclizations with diester, ketoamide, diamide, and amide functionalities, which were previously problematic to achieve using gold catalysis as described by the Toste group. 8 This limitation of the gold-catalyzed Conia-ene cyclization was also observed in our previous work related to the synthesis of functionalized tetrahydrofurans and $\gamma$-butyrolactones.},

@article{Tan2006b,
abstract = {Interactions among Bcl-2 family proteins mediated by Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions transform apoptosis signals into actions. The interactions between BH3 region-only proteins and multi-BH region proteins such as Bax and Bcl-2 have been proposed to be the dominant interactions required for initiating apoptosis. Experimental evidence also suggests that both homo- and hetero-interactions are mediated primarily by the BH3 regions in all Bcl-2 family proteins and contribute to commitment to or inhibition of apoptosis. We found that a peptide containing the BH3 helix of Bax was not sufficient to activate recombinant Bax to permeabilize mitochondria. However, an extended peptide containing the BH3 helix and additional downstream sequences activated Bax to permeabilize mitochondria and liposomes. Bcl-2 inhibited the membrane-permeabilizing activity of peptide-activated Bax. This activity of Bcl-2 was inhibited by the extended but not the BH3-only peptide despite both peptides binding to Bcl-2 with similar affinity. Further, membrane-bound Bax activation intermediates directly activated soluble Bax further permeabilizing the membrane. Bcl-2 inhibited Bax auto-activation. We therefore propose that Bax auto-activation amplifies the initial death signal produced by BH3-only proteins and that Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of Bax auto-activation.},
