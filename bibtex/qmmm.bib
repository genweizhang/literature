LICHEM extracts forces and energies from unmodified QM and MM software packages to perform geometry optimizations, single-point energy calculations, or Monte Carlo simulations.

abstract = {Computational enzymology is a rapidly maturing field that is increasingly integral to understanding mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and their practical applications. Combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods are important in this field. By treating the reacting species with a quantum mechanical method (i.e., a method that calculates the electronic structure of the active site) and including the enzyme environment with simpler molecular mechanical methods, enzyme reactions can be modeled. Here, we review QM/MM methods and their application to enzyme-catalyzed reactions to investigate fundamental and practical problems in enzymology. A range of QM/MM methods is available, from cheaper and more approximate methods, which can be used for molecular dynamics simulations, to highly accurate electronic structure methods. We discuss how modeling of reactions using such methods can provide detailed insight into enzyme mechanisms and illustrate this by reviewing some recent applications. We outline some practical considerations for such simulations. Further, we highlight applications that show how QM/MM methods can contribute to the practical development and application of enzymology, e.g., in the interpretation and prediction of the effects of mutagenesis and in drug and catalyst design.},

abstract = {Combined quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) approaches have become the method of choice for modeling reactions in biomolecular systems. Quantum-mechanical (QM) methods are required for describing chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge transfer or electronic excitation. However, QM methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for methods capable of treating up to several 100,000 atoms and allowing for simulations over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. This is achieved by highly efficient, force-field-based molecular mechanics (MM) methods. Thus to model large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques and to use a QM method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an MM treatment for the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes are commonly referred to as combined or hybrid QM/MM methods. They enable the modeling of reactive biomolecular systems at a reasonable computational effort while providing the necessary accuracy.},

This review describes the state of the art in addressing this challenge by simulating enzymatic reactions. It considers different modeling methods including the empirical valence bond (EVB) and more standard molecular orbital quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. The importance of proper configurational averaging of QM/MM energies is emphasized, pointing out that at present such averages are performed most effectively by the EVB method. It is clarified that all properly conducted simulation studies have identified electrostatic preorganization effects as the source of enzyme catalysis. It is argued that the ability to simulate enzymatic reactions also provides the chance to examine the importance of nonelectrostatic contributions and the validity of the corresponding proposals. In fact, simulation studies have indicated that prominent proposals such as desolvation, steric strain, near attack conformation, entropy traps, and coherent dynamics do not account for a major part of the catalytic power of enzymes. Finally, it is pointed out that although some of the issues are likely to remain controversial for some time, computer modeling approaches can provide a powerful tool for understanding enzyme catalysis.},

The developed method is general enough to be applied to any QM/MM method and partition, provided an accurate tuning of a small number of parameters is obtained. The coupling of the method with both nonpolarizable and fully polarizable QM/fluctuating charge (FQ) approaches is reported and applied. A suitable parametrization for the aqueous solution, so that its most representative features are well reproduced, is outlined. Then, the obtained parametrization and method are applied to calculate the nonelectrostatic (repulsion and dispersion) interaction energy of nicotine in aqueous solution.},

The equation-of-motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations method (EOM-CCSD) is used for the QM region, while the effective fragment potential (EFP) method describes a MM part. The EFP method overcomes the most significant limitation of QM/MM by replacing empirical MM interactions and QM/MM coupling by parameter-free first-principles-based ones, while retaining the computational efficiency of QM/MM. The developed QM/MM scheme involves quantum-mechanical coupling of the electrostatic and polarization terms in the QM/MM Hamiltonian and allows accurate calculation of the electronic excited states of chromophores in various environments. Applications to the water complexes of formaldehyde and p-nitroaniline show that the orbital relaxation of the solute in the electric field of the solvent provides the majority of the solvatochromic effect, and the response of the polarizable environment to the density of the specific electronic state is much smaller in magnitude.},
