@article{Casida2012,
abstract = {The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s is based on the idea that the complicated N-electron wave function can be replaced with the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic structure calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT cannot treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT have grown, so too has our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in Volume 55 of the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry left off and highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Because doubly-excited states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis is placed on the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation, which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states.},

Some timing results are shown from a B3LYP/6-31G**/SG-1-grid calculation on zincporphyrin. We also performed TDDFT/TDA geometry optimizations for low-lying excited states of 20 small molecules, and compared adiabatic excitation energies and optimized geometry parameters to experimental values using the B3LYP and $\omega$B97 functionals. There are only minor differences between TDDFT and TDA optimized excited state geometries and adiabatic excitation energies. Optimized bond lengths are in better agreement with experiment for both functionals than either CC2 or SOS-CIS(D0), while adiabatic excitation energies are in similar or slightly poorer agreement. Optimized bond angles with both functionals are more accurate than CIS values, but less a...},

@article{Marques2004,
abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can be viewed as an exact reformulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics, where the fundamental variable is no longer the many-body wave function but the density. This time-dependent density is determined by solving an auxiliary set of noninteracting Schrodinger equations, the Kohn-Sham equations. The nontrivial part of the many-body interaction is contained in the so-called exchange-correlation potential, for which reasonably good approximations exist. Within TDDFT two regimes can be distinguished: (a) If the external time-dependent potential is "small," the complete numerical solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations can be avoided by the use of linear response theory. This is the case, e.g., for the calculation of photoabsorption spectra. (b) For a "strong" external potential, a full solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations is in order. This situation is encountered, for instance, when matter interacts with intense laser fields. In this review we give an overview of TDDFT from its theoretical foundations to several applications both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime.},

@article{Isegawa2012,
abstract = {We report a test of 30 density functionals, including several recent ones, for their predictions of 69 singlet-to-singlet excitation energies of 11 molecules. The reference values are experimental results collected by Caricato et al. for 30 valence excitations and 39 Rydberg excitations. All calculations employ time-dependent density functional theory in the adiabatic, linear-response approximation. As far as reasonable, all of the assignments are performed by essentially the same protocol as used by Caricato et al., and this allows us to merge our mean unsigned errors (MUEs) with the ones they calculated for both density functional and wave function methods. We find 21 of the 30 density functionals calculated here have smaller MUEs for the 30 valence states than what they obtained (0.47 eV) for the state-of-the-art EOM-CCSD wave function. In contrast, for all of density functionals the MUE for 39 Rydberg states is larger than that (0.11 eV) of EOM-CCSD. Merging the 30 density functionals calculated here with the 26 calculated by Caricato et al. makes a set of 56 density functionals. Averaging the unsigned errors over both the valence excitations and the Rydberg excitations, none of the 56 density functionals shows a lower mean unsigned error than that (0.27 eV) of EOM-CCSD. Nevertheless, two functionals are successful in having an overall mean unsigned error of 0.30 eV, and another nine are moderately successful in having overall mean unsigned errors in the range 0.32-0.36 eV. Successful or moderately successful density functionals include seven hybrid density functionals with 41{\%} to 54{\%} Hartree-Fock exchange, and four range-separated hybrid density functionals in which the percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange increases from 0{\%} to 19{\%} at small interelectronic separation to 65{\%}-100{\%} at long range.},

The results from TD-DFT (with the functionals BP86, B3LYP, and BHLYP) and from DFT/MRCI are compared against the previous high-level ab initio results, and, in particular, against the proposed best estimates for 104 singlet and 63 triplet vertical excitation energies. The statistical evaluation for the latter reference data gives the lowest mean absolute deviations for DFT/MRCI (0.22 eV for singlets and 0.24 eV for triplets) followed by TD-DFT/B3LYP (0.27 and 0.44 eV, respectively), whereas TD-DFT/BP86 and TD-DFT/BHLYP are significantly less accurate.

One of these approximations is equivalent to the “TDDFT for molecular interactions” [TDDFT(MI)] method that we have introduced previously, which exploits non-orthogonal, absolutely-localized molecular orbitals to approximate full TDDFT for systems consisting of multiple, weakly-coupled chromophores. Further approximations are possible when the excitation is localized on only a single subsystem and are introduced here to reduce the cost of LEA-TDDFT(MI) with respect even to TDDFT(MI). We apply these methods to compute solvatochromatic shifts for the n → $\pi$* excitations in aqueous acetone and pyridine.
