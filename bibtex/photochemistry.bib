@article{Bush2008,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, and it is characterized by elevated brain iron levels and accumulation of copper and zinc in cerebral beta-amyloid deposits (e.g., senile plaques). Both ionic zinc and copper are able to accelerate the aggregation of Abeta, the principle component of beta-amyloid deposits. Copper (and iron) can also promote the neurotoxic redox activity of Abeta and induce oxidative cross-linking of the peptide into stable oligomers. Recent reports have documented the release of Abeta together with ionic zinc and copper in cortical glutamatergic synapses after excitation. This, in turn, leads to the formation of Abeta oligomers, which, in turn, modulates long-term potentiation by controlling synaptic levels of the NMDA receptor. The excessive accumulation of Abeta oligomers in the synaptic cleft would then be predicted to adversely affect synaptic neurotransmission. Based on these findings, we have proposed the "Metal Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease," which stipulates that the neuropathogenic effects of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease are promoted by (and possibly even dependent on) Abeta-metal interactions. Increasingly sophisticated pharmaceutical approaches are now being implemented to attenuate abnormal Abeta-metal interactions without causing systemic disturbance of essential metals. Small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions (e.g., PBT2) are currently advancing through clinical trials and show increasing promise as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease based on the "metal hypothesis."},

@article{Markesbery1997,
abstract = {The major hurdle in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a lack of knowledge about the etiology and pathogenesis of selective neuron death. In recent years, considerable data have accrued indicating that the brain in AD is under increased oxidative stress and this may have a role in the pathogenesis of neuron degeneration and death in this disorder. The direct evidence supporting increased oxidative stress in AD is: (1) increased brain Fe, Al, and Hg in AD, capable of stimulating free radical generation; (2) increased lipid peroxidation and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids in the AD brain, and increased 4-hydroxynonenal, an aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation in AD ventricular fluid; (3) increased protein and DNA oxidation in the AD brain; (4) diminished energy metabolism and decreased cytochrome c oxidase in the brain in AD; (5) advanced glycation end products (AGE), malondialdehyde, carbonyls, peroxynitrite, heme oxygenase- 1 and SOD- 1 in neurofibrillary tangles and AGE, heme oxygenase-1, SOD-I in senile plaques; and (6) studies showing that amyloid beta peptide is capable of generating free radicals. Supporting indirect evidence comes from a variety of in vitro studies showing that free radicals are capable of mediating neuron degeneration and death. Overall, these studies indicate that free radicals are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of neuron death in AD. Because tissue injury itself can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, it is not known whether this is a primary or secondary event. Even if free radical generation is secondary to other initiating causes, they are deleterious and part of a cascade of events that can lead to neuron death, suggesting that therapeutic efforts aimed at removal of ROS or prevention of their formation may be beneficial in AD.},

@article{Canard2017,
abstract = {Molecules displaying a p-conjugated D–A–D structure, in which D and A are electron donor and acceptor groups, respectively, represent an important class of dyes. In this work, we present a series of borondifluoride complexes of curcuminoid derivatives in which the central dioxaborine ring acts as a strong electron acceptor unit. Compounds 1–15 differ by the nature of the terminal D groups. We have also studied unsymmetrical compounds 16–23 that contain two different terminal donor groups, as well as compounds 24–32 in which an electron acceptor or donor unit has been introduced at the meso position of the dioxaborine ring. We describe the synthesis of the dyes that have not yet been reported in the literature, and report the electrochemical, absorption and fluorescence properties of all the compounds in dichloromethane. To gain insights into the electronic structures and optical properties, we performed DFT/TD-DFT calculations for a panel of representative compounds. We established correlations between the reduction potential and the Hammett s and s + constants, as well as between the redox gap and the emission wavelength. The electron donor character of one terminal D unit strongly influences (88 mV per unit of s) the reduction potential due to the strong resonance interaction along the curcuminoid backbone. The correlation points to the smaller effect of the meso substituent (50 mV per unit of s), which we relate to the twisted ground-state geometry of the meso aryl substituent. The correlation models established in this study may be useful to anticipate the optical and electrochemical properties of borondifluoride complexes of curcuminoids with good reliability.},

@article{Shen2007,
abstract = {Curcumin is a yellow-orange pigment, which has attracted considerable attention due to its wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. In spite of much effort devoted on curcumin, there still exist some open questions concerning its fundamental physicochemical properties. The present study suggests that the DFT and TD-DFT calculations are useful to answer these questions. Firstly, the thermodynamic as well as spectral parameters support that curcumin exists predominantly in enol form in solution. Secondly, the calculated absorption spectra of curcumin anions provides direct evidence that the lowest pKa of curcumin corresponds to the dissociation of enolic proton, which not only reconciles the controversy on this topic, but also has important implications on the proton-transfer/dissociation-associated radical-scavenging mechanisms of curcumin.},

@article{Huang2005,
abstract = {A hallmark of all forms of neurodegenerative diseases is impairment of neuronal functions, and in many cases neuronal cell death. Although the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases may be distinct, different diseases display a similar pathogenesis, for example abnormal immunity within the central nervous system (CNS), activation of macrophage/microglia and the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies show that neurons in a neurodegenerative state undergo a highly regulated programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF family, has been shown to be involved in apoptosis during many diseases. As one member of a death ligand family, TRAIL was originally thought to target only tumor cells and was not present in CNS. However, recent data showed that TRAIL was unregulated in HIV-1-infected and immune-activated macrophages, a major disease inducing cell during HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). TRAIL is also induced on neuron by beta-amyloid protein, an important pathogen for Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we summarize the possible common aspects that TRAIL involved those neurodegenerative diseases, TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling in the CNS cells, and specific role of TRAIL in individual diseases.},

The syntheisis, characterization, and spectroscopic properties of 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene (PRODAN), a compound that fulfills these conditions, are described. The maximum of emission is at 401 nm in cyclohexane solution and at 531 nm in water solution, indicating an increase of dipole moment of approximately 20 D units on excitation to the lowest singlet state. The effect of temperature upon the spectral distribution and the bandwidth of fluorescence of PRODAN in 1:1 complexes with albumin shows the existence of a dynamic relaxation process of the protein surroundings within th 2-4 ns of the fluorescence lifetime.},
