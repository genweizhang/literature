abstract = {Relieving the strain: The rhodium(I)-catalyzed activation of C-C bonds in functionalized cyclobutanes opens a novel route to highly substituted carbo- and heterocycles. Particularly intriguing is the differentiation of enantiotopic C-C bonds, which leads to the formation of highly enantiomerically enriched lactones, cyclopentanones, and cyclohexenones (see scheme).},
