abstract = {A general scheme for systematically modeling long-range corrected (LC) hybrid density functionals is proposed. Our resulting two LC hybrid functionals are shown to be accurate in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions, when compared with common hybrid density functionals. The qualitative failures of the commonly used hybrid density functionals in some "difficult problems," such as dissociation of symmetric radical cations and long-range charge-transfer excitations, are significantly reduced by the present LC hybrid density functionals.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to combine Hartree-Fock theory with local density-functional theory have been unsuccessful in applications to molecular bonding. We derive a new coupling of these two theories that maintains their simplicity and computational efficiency, and yet greatly improves their predictive power. Very encouraging results of tests on atomization energies, ionization potentials, and proton affinities are reported, and the potential for future development is discussed.},

@article{Lee1988,
abstract = {A correlation-energy formula due to Colle and Salvetti Theor. Chim. Acta 37, 329 (1975), in which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix, is restated as a formula involving the density and local kinetic-energy density. On insertion of gradient expansions for the local kinetic-energy density, density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then obtained. Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.},
