abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging is a powerful approach for visualizing specific events occurring inside live mice. Animals can be made to glow in response to the expression of a gene, the activity of an enzyme, or the growth of a tumor. But bioluminescence requires the interaction of a luciferase enzyme with a small-molecule luciferin, and its scope has been limited by the mere handful of natural combinations. Herein, we show that mutants of firefly luciferase can discriminate between natural and synthetic substrates in the brains of live mice. When using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to express luciferases in the brain, we found that mutant luciferases that are inactive or weakly active with d-luciferin can light up brightly when treated with the aminoluciferins CycLuc1 and CycLuc2 or their respective FAAH-sensitive luciferin amides. Further development of selective luciferases promises to expand the power of bioluminescence and allow multiple events to be imaged in the same live animal.},

This bioluminescent probe was accessed using C-H activation methodology and was found to be stable in solution and capable of light production with firefly luciferase. The luciferin analogue was also cell permeant and emitted more redshifted light than d-luciferin, the native luciferase substrate. Based on these features, the alkynyl luciferin will be useful for a variety of imaging applications.},

However, the need for re-examination has also been discussed4, 5, 6. In this letter we quantify quantum yields and colour changes using our new total-photon-flux spectrometer20, 21. We determine the highest quantum yield to be 41.0 ± 7.4{\%} (1 standard deviation (s.d.) estimate, coverage factor k = 1), and find that bioluminescence spectra are systematically decomposed into one pH-sensitive and two pH-insensitive gaussian components. There is no intensity conversion between yellow-green and red emissions through pH equilibrium, but simple intensity variation of the pH-sensitive gaussian peak at 2.2 eV causes the changes in emission colours. This represents a paradigm shift in the concept of colour determination from long-standing interpretation based on pH equilibrium.},

@article{Nakatsu2006,
abstract = {Fireflies communicate with each other by emitting yellow-green to yellow-orange brilliant light. The bioluminescence reaction, which uses luciferin, Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen to yield an electronically excited oxyluciferin species, is carried out by the enzyme luciferase. Visible light is emitted during relaxation of excited oxyluciferin to its ground state. The high quantum yield of the luciferin/luciferase reaction and the change in bioluminescence colour caused by subtle structural differences in luciferase have attracted much research interest. In fact, a single amino acid substitution in luciferase changes the emission colour from yellow-green to red. Although the crystal structure of luciferase from the North American firefly (Photinus pyralis) has been described, the detailed mechanism for the bioluminescence colour change is still unclear. Here we report the crystal structures of wild-type and red mutant (S286N) luciferases from the Japanese Genji-botaru (Luciola cruciata) in complex with a high-energy intermediate analogue, 5'-O-[N-(dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine (DLSA). Comparing these structures to those of the wild-type luciferase complexed with AMP plus oxyluciferin (products) reveals a significant conformational change in the wild-type enzyme but not in the red mutant. This conformational change involves movement of the hydrophobic side chain of Ile 288 towards the benzothiazole ring of DLSA. Our results indicate that the degree of molecular rigidity of the excited state of oxyluciferin, which is controlled by a transient movement of Ile 288, determines the colour of bioluminescence during the emission reaction.},

abstract = {Dynamics of the firefly luciferase-oxyluciferin complex in its electronic ground and excited states are studied using various theoretical approaches. By mimicking the physiological conditions with realistic models of the chromophore oxyluciferin, the enzyme luciferase, and solvating water molecules and by performing real time simulations with a molecular dynamics technique on the model surfaces, we reveal that the local chromophore-surrounding interaction patterns differ rather severely in the two states. Because of the presence of protein, the solvation dynamics of water around the chromophore is also peculiar and shows widely different time scales on the two terminal oxygen atoms. In addition, simulations of the emission with the quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics approach show a close relationship between the emission color variation and the environmental dynamics, mostly through electrostatic effects from the chromophore-surrounding interaction. We also discuss the importance of considering the time scales of the luminescence and the dynamics of the interaction.},

Despite its popularity, bioluminescence has long been hindered by a lack of distinguishable probes. Here we present a method to rapidly identify new substrate-selective luciferases for multicomponent imaging. Our strategy relies on parallel screening of luciferin analogues with panels of mutant enzymes. The compiled data set is then analyzed in silico to uncover mutually orthogonal sets. Using this approach, we screened 159 mutant enzymes with 12 luciferins. Thousands of orthogonal pairs were revealed with sufficient selectivity for use in biological environments. Over 100 pairs were validated in vitro, and three were applied in cell and animal models. The parallel screening method is both generalizable and scalable and will streamline the search for larger collections of orthogonal probes.},

In particular, a bioluminescence reaction of 1-pyrrolidinyl analogue with a recombinant Photinus pyralis luciferase showed a higher quantum yield than that with AkaLumine, giving an improved bioluminescence intensity. The 1-pyrrolidinyl analogue also showed the strongest luminescence in whole-body luciferase-expressing mice among the analogues, indicating that a quantum yield improvement of a luciferin analogue is effective to increase bioluminescence imaging intensity.},

@article{Iwano2018,
abstract = {Bioluminescence is a natural light source based on luciferase catalysis of its substrate luciferin. We performed directed evolution on firefly luciferase using a red-shifted and highly deliverable luciferin analog to establish AkaBLI, an all-engineered bioluminescence in vivo imaging system. AkaBLI produced emissions in vivo that were brighter by a factor of 100 to 1000 than conventional systems, allowing noninvasive visualization of single cells deep inside freely moving animals. Single tumorigenic cells trapped in the mouse lung vasculature could be visualized. In the mouse brain, genetic labeling with neural activity sensors allowed tracking of small clusters of hippocampal neurons activated by novel environments. In a marmoset, we recorded video-rate bioluminescence from neurons in the striatum, a deep brain area, for more than 1 year. AkaBLI is therefore a bioengineered light source to spur unprecedented scientific, medical, and industrial applications. B ioluminescence imaging (BLI) is based on the detection of light produced by the en-zyme (luciferase)–catalyzed oxidation re-action of a substrate (luciferin) (1, 2). In vivo BLI is a noninvasive method for mea-suring light output from luciferase-expressing cells after luciferin administration in living ani-mals (3), and this method typically employs firefly luciferase (Fluc) and the natural substrate D-luciferin (Fig. 1A, left) that produces longer-wavelength (green-yellow) light and is more stable for enzymatic reaction after administra-tion than the other commonly used luciferase substrate, coelenterazine (4–7). However, due to its relatively low tissue permeability, D-luciferin has a heterogeneous biodistribution in the body (8). The low affinity (high Michaelis constant, K M) of D-luciferin for Fluc also suggests un-even saturation of the Fluc reporter enzyme with substrate in vivo. In particular, in vivo BLI in the brain has been hampered due to low pas-sage of D-luciferin through the blood-brain bar-rier (BBB) (8). In recent years, synthetic analogs of D-luciferin were reported (9–11), including AkaLumine (Fig. 1A, right), that when catalyzed by Fluc produces near-infrared emission peak-ing at 677 nm, which can penetrate most animal tissues and bodies. We previously demonstrated that AkaLumine hydrochloride (AkaLumine-HCl) has favorable biodistribution to access Fluc-expressing cells in deep organs such as the lung and can saturate Fluc more effectively than D-luciferin (12). We hypothesized that Fluc is not enzymati-cally optimal for AkaLumine-HCl; therefore, we performed directed evolution on the luciferase gene through successive rounds of mutagenesis, screening, and validation to develop an enzyme that could strongly pair with AkaLumine-HCl. We constructed gene libraries encoding vari-ants of three luciferases (13)—Fluc, emerald lu-ciferase (Eluc), and crick beetle red luciferase (CBRluc)—and screened them by selecting for bacterial colonies with brighter emission in the presence of AkaLumine (fig. S1A). Candidates in the Fluc-based library were iteratively screened with multiple cycles of random mutagenesis (fig. S1B) to produce Akaluc, which has 28 amino acid substitutions relative to Fluc (fig. S1C). Appli-cation of D-luciferin and AkaLumine on bacte-rial colonies expressing Akaluc or Fluc enabled bright near-infrared emission with AkaLumine/ Akaluc and very weak emission with the other combinations (fig. S2). In vitro experiments with purified luciferases (Fig. 1B) showed that Akaluc catalyzed AkaLumine {\~{}}7 times more efficiently},

abstract = {Hypochlorite (ClO–) is one of the most important reactive oxygen species but using a BL probe for its selective detection (or imaging) still remains challenging. Herein, we report a latent BL probe benzoylhydrazine luciferin (1) for highly selective detection of ClO– in vitro and imaging ClO– in living cells and tumors. In vitro tests indicated that 1 could be applied for highly selective detection of ClO– within the range of 0–62.5 $\mu$M with a limit of detection of 0.705 $\mu$M. Using these unique features of 1, we successfully applied it to image ClO– in living cells and tumors. We envision that probe 1 might be applied to elucidate the biological roles of ClO– in wider physiological and pathological processes in the near future.},
