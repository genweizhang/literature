abstract = {Recent experimental investigation (Reitzenstein and Lambert,Macromolecules, 2009, 42, 773) indicated that the quite different optical properties of 2,7- and 3,6-linkage triarylboryl carbazole oligomers may arise from the different nature of their low-lying excited states: a low-lying delocalized within-backbone excitation in longer 2,7-linked oligomers vs a backbone-to-sidechain charge-transfer (CT) excitation independent of the polymerization length in 3,6-linked oligomers. Here in this paper, two long-range corrected functionals, CAM-B3LYP and $\omega$B97X, are applied together with the traditional B3LYP functional in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to systematically investigate the low-lying electronic excitations in both oligomers. Our calculations indicate that an extensive conjugation exists between monomer molecular orbitals in 2,7-linked oligomers, which is absent in those of 3,6-linked structures, resulting in a considerable narrowing of the HOMO-LUMO gap of their backbone moiety, while having little effect on the side-chains. CAM-B3LYP and $\omega$B97x calculations confirm that the lowest-energy absorption is a within-backbone excitation in longer 2,7-linked oligomers as opposed to a backbone to side-chain charge transfer excitation in 2,7-linked oligmers of shorter length and 3,6-linked oligomers of any length. All these findings are consistent with the experimental findings and the qualitative energy diagram proposed by Reitzenstein and Lambert.},

abstract = {Since two decades, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been in the limelight due to its noteworthy efficiency. Indeed, in many cases, TD-DFT provides accurate excited-state properties for a relatively limited computational cost. Recently, there has been a rapidly growing interest in applications of TD-DFT (partly) exploring the excited-state potential energy surfaces. In this review, we summarize such TD-DFT investigations going beyond the vertical approxi-mation and devoted to spectroscopic applications, with a focus on both 0â€“0 ener-gies and vibrationally resolved absorption and emission spectra. We show how these quantities can be computed, considering various models for the latter, and illustrate their advantages compared to vertical estimates in terms of compari-sons with experimental data.},

abstract = {In this tutorial review, we show how Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) has become a popular tool for computing the signatures of electronically excited states, and more specifically, the properties directly related to the optical (absorption and emission) spectra of molecules. We discuss the properties that can be obtained with widely available programs as well as how to account for the environmental effects (solvent and surfaces) and present recent applications in these fields. We next expose the transformation of the TD-DFT results into chemically intuitive parameters (colours as well as charge-transfer distances). Eventually, the non-specialised reader will find a series of advices and warnings necessary to perform her/his first TD-DFT calculations.},

@article{Jacquemin2009a,
abstract = {Since Antiquity, humans have produced and commercialized dyes. To this day, extraction of natural dyes often requires lengthy and costly procedures. In the 19th century, global markets and new industrial products drove a significant effort to synthesize artificial dyes, characterized by low production costs, huge quantities, and new optical properties (colors). Dyes that encompass classes of molecules absorbing in the UV-visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum now have a wider range of applications, including coloring (textiles, food, paintings), energy production (photovoltaic cells, OLEDs), or pharmaceuticals (diagnostics, drugs). Parallel to the growth in dye applications, researchers have increased their efforts to design and synthesize new dyes to customize absorption and emission properties. In particular, dyes containing one or more metallic centers allow for the construction of fairly sophisticated systems capable of selectively reacting to light of a given wavelength and behaving as molecular devices (photochemical molecular devices, PMDs).Theoretical tools able to predict and interpret the excited-state properties of organic and inorganic dyes allow for an efficient screening of photochemical centers. In this Account, we report recent developments defining a quantitative ab initio protocol (based on time-dependent density functional theory) for modeling dye spectral properties. In particular, we discuss the importance of several parameters, such as the methods used for electronic structure calculations, solvent effects, and statistical treatments. In addition, we illustrate the performance of such simulation tools through case studies. We also comment on current weak points of these methods and ways to improve them.},

abstract = {In this study we have introduced a formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on a noncollinear exchange-correlation potential. This formulation is a generalization of conventional TDDFT. The form of this formulation is exactly the same as that of the conventional TDDFT for the excitation energies of transitions that do not involve spin flips. In addition, this noncollinear TDDFT formulation allows for spin-flip transitions. This feature makes it possible to resolve more fully excited state spin multiplets, while for closed-shell systems, the spin-flip transitions will result in singlet-triplet excitations and this excitation energy calculated from this formulation of TDDFT is exactly the same as that from ordinary TDDFT. This formulation is applied to the dissociation of H(2) in its (1)Sigma(g) (+) ground state and (1)Sigma(u) (+) and (3)Sigma(u) (-) excited states with (3)Sigma(u) (-) (M(s)=+1) as the reference state and the multiplets splitting of some atoms.},

abstract = {In the present work we have studied the accuracy of excitation energies calculated from spin-flip transitions with a formulation of time-dependent density functional theory based on a noncollinear exchange-correlation potential proposed in a previous study. We compared the doublet-doublet excitation energies from spin-flip transitions and ordinary transitions, calculated the multiplets splitting of some atoms, the singlet-triplet gaps of some diradicals, the energies of excited quartet states with a doublet ground state. In addition, we attempted to calculate transition energies with excited states as reference. We compared the triplet excitation energies and singlet-triplet separations of the excited state from spin-flip and ordinary transitions. As an application, we show that using excited quartet state as reference can help us fully resolve excited states spin multiplets. In total the obtained excitation energies calculated from spin-flip transitions agree quite well with other theoretical results or experimental data.},
