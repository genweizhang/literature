abstract = {A new method for calculating the solvation energy of an arbitrary shape solute is presented. In this method, the solvents is treated as a homogeneous dielectric medium with a cavity. The solvation energy is presented in the Hartee-Fock-Roothaan form, which can be incorporated into both molecular orbital and density functional theories, as well as in the classical theory using the distributed monopole approach. We found that this approach yields on the average of 10{\%} additional CPU time compared to the gas-phase calculations and an accuracy of better than 2.0 kcal/mol for neutral polar solutes but somewhat larger for ions.},

abstract = {An overview is given of the present state of the art of continuum models and about perspectives for the future. First, QM versions of the continuum solvation models are outlined. Second, models for solvation effects in very little solutions are elaborated. Third, topics of different origins from which there is still the need of further methodological elaboration are discussed. Finally, the combination of continuum and discrete representations of the medium is described.},

@article{Lange2010,
abstract = {Apparent surface charge, reaction-field solvation models often employ overlapping atomic spheres to represent the solute/continuum boundary. Discretization of the solute cavity surface, however, results in a boundary-element method that fails to afford a continuous potential energy surface for the solute. Several proposed remedies for this problem, based upon switching functions for the surface grid points and originally introduced for the conductor-like screening model (COSMO), are generalized here to an entire class of polarizable continuum models (PCMs). Gaussian blurring of the apparent surface charges proves to be crucial in order to avoid singularities in the reaction-field matrix and spurious oscillations in the energy gradient. The resulting smooth PCMs accelerate convergence of geometry optimizations and eliminate spurious peaks in vibrational spectra that are calculated by finite difference of analytic energy gradients.},

@article{Tomasi1999,
abstract = {The integral equation formalism (IEF) is a recent method (the grounds have been elaborated at the beginning of 1997) addressed to solve the electrostatic solvation problem at the QM level with the aid of apparent surface charges (ASC). IEF uses a new formalism of this problem, based on integral operators never used before in the chemical community and it manages to treat on the same footing linear isotropic solvent models, as well as anisotropic liquid crystals and ionic solutions. In this overview we emphasize the good performances of IEF at the lowest level of its potentialities, i.e. for isotropic solvents, as a new approach to compute solvation free energies and properties (dipole hyperpolarizabilities) of molecular solutes, as well as energy gradients for geometry optimization procedures. Finally we present a new IEF implementation of the nonequilibrium problem for electronic spectra which appears to be decidedly competitive with the previous more standard ASC formulations. á­§},

@article{You2015,
abstract = {The Marcus and Pekar partitions are common, alternative models to describe the non-equilibrium dielectric polarization response that accompanies instantaneous perturbation of a solute embedded in a dielectric continuum. Examples of such a perturbation include vertical electronic excitation and vertical ionization of a solution-phase molecule. Here, we provide a general derivation of the accompanying polarization response, for a quantum-mechanical solute described within the framework of a polarizable continuum model (PCM) of electrostatic solvation. Although the non-equilibrium free energy is formally equivalent within the two partitions, albeit partitioned differently into "fast" versus "slow" polarization contributions, discretization of the PCM integral equations fails to preserve certain symmetries contained in these equations (except in the case of the conductor-like models or when the solute cavity is spherical), leading to alternative, non-equivalent matrix equations. Unlike the total equilibrium solvation energy, however, which can differ dramatically between different formulations, we demonstrate that the equivalence of the Marcus and Pekar partitions for the non-equilibrium solvation correction is preserved to high accuracy. Differences in vertical excitation and ionization energies are {\textless}0.2 eV (and often {\textless}0.01 eV), even for systems specifically selected to afford a large polarization response. Numerical results therefore support the interchangeability of the Marcus and Pekar partitions, but also caution against relying too much on the fast PCM charges for interpretive value, as these charges differ greatly between the two partitions, especially in polar solvents.},
