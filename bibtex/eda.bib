abstract = {An efficient method for removing the self-consistent field (SCF) diagonalization bottleneck is proposed for systems of weakly interacting components. The method is based on the equations of the locally projected SCF for molecular interactions (SCF MI) which utilize absolutely localized nonorthogonal molecular orbitals expanded in local subsets of the atomic basis set. A generalization of direct inversion in the iterative subspace for nonorthogonal molecular orbitals is formulated to increase the rate of convergence of the SCF MI equations. Single Roothaan step perturbative corrections are developed to improve the accuracy of the SCF MI energies. The resulting energies closely reproduce the conventional SCF energy. Extensive test calculations are performed on water clusters up to several hundred molecules. Compared to conventional SCF, speedups of the order of (N/O)2 have been achieved for the diagonalization step, where N is the size of the atomic orbital basis, and O is the number of occupied molecular orbitals.},

abstract = {A new method based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs) is proposed to measure the degree of intermolecular electron density delocalization (charge transfer) in molecular complexes. ALMO charge transfer analysis (CTA) enables separation of the forward and backward charge transfer components for each pair of molecules in the system. The key feature of ALMO CTA is that all charge transfer terms have corresponding well defined energetic effects that measure the contribution of the given term to the overall energetic stabilization of the system. To simplify analysis of charge transfer effects, the concept of chemically significant complementary occupied-virtual orbital pairs (COVPs) is introduced. COVPs provide a simple description of intermolecular electron transfer effects in terms of just a few localized orbitals. ALMO CTA is applied to understand fundamental aspects of donor-acceptor interactions in borane adducts, synergic bonding in classical and nonclassical metal carbonyls, and multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds in a complex of isocyanuric acid and melamine. These examples show that the ALMO CTA results are generally consistent with the existing conceptual description of intermolecular bonding. The results also show that charge transfer and the energy lowering due to charge transfer are not proportional to each other, and some interesting differences emerge which are discussed. Additionally, according to ALMO CTA, the amount of electron density transferred between molecules is significantly smaller than charge transfer estimated from various population analysis methods.},

@article{Sherrill2013,
abstract = {Fundamental features of biomolecules, such as their structure, solvation, and crystal packing and even the docking of drugs, rely on noncovalent interactions. Theory can help elucidate the nature of these interactions, and energy component analysis reveals the contributions from the various intermolecular forces: electrostatics, London dispersion terms, induction (polarization), and short-range exchange-repulsion. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides one method for this type of analysis. In this Account, we show several examples of how SAPT provides insight into the nature of noncovalent $\pi$-interactions. In cation-$\pi$ interactions, the cation strongly polarizes electrons in $\pi$-orbitals, leading to substantially attractive induction terms. This polarization is so important that a cation and a benzene attract each other when placed in the same plane, even though a consideration of the electrostatic interactions alone would suggest otherwise. SAPT analysis can also support an understanding of substituent effects in $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions. Trends in face-to-face sandwich benzene dimers cannot be understood solely in terms of electrostatic effects, especially for multiply substituted dimers, but SAPT analysis demonstrates the importance of London dispersion forces. Moreover, detailed SAPT studies also reveal the critical importance of charge penetration effects in $\pi$-stacking interactions. These effects arise in cases with substantial orbital overlap, such as in $\pi$-stacking in DNA or in crystal structures of $\pi$-conjugated materials. These charge penetration effects lead to attractive electrostatic terms where a simpler analysis based on atom-centered charges, electrostatic potential plots, or even distributed multipole analysis would incorrectly predict repulsive electrostatics. SAPT analysis of sandwich benzene, benzene-pyridine, and pyridine dimers indicates that dipole/induced-dipole terms present in benzene-pyridine but not in benzene dimer are relatively unimportant. In general, a nitrogen heteroatom contracts the electron density, reducing the magnitude of both the London dispersion and the exchange-repulsion terms, but with an overall net increase in attraction. Finally, using recent advances in SAPT algorithms, researchers can now perform SAPT computations on systems with 200 atoms or more. We discuss a recent study of the intercalation complex of proflavine with a trinucleotide duplex of DNA. Here, London dispersion forces are the strongest contributors to binding, as is typical for $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions. However, the electrostatic terms are larger than usual on a fractional basis, which likely results from the positive charge on the intercalator and its location between two electron-rich base pairs. These cation-$\pi$ interactions also increase the induction term beyond those of typical noncovalent $\pi$-interactions.},

@article{Lao2016a,
abstract = {Many schemes for decomposing quantum-chemical calculations of intermolecular interaction energies into physically meaningful components can be found in the literature, but the definition of the charge-transfer (CT) contribution has proven particularly vexing to define in a satisfactory way and typically depends strongly on the choice of basis set. This is problematic, especially in cases of dative bonding and for open-shell complexes involving cation radicals, for which one might expect significant CT. Here, we analyze CT interactions predicted by several popular energy decomposition analyses and ultimately recommend the definition afforded by constrained density functional theory (cDFT), as it is scarcely dependent on basis set and provides results that are in accord with chemical intuition in simple cases, and in quantitative agreement with experimental estimates of the CT energy, where available. For open-shell complexes, the cDFT approach affords CT energies that are in line with trends expected based on ionization potentials and electron affinities whereas some other definitions afford unreasonably large CT energies in large-gap systems, which are sometimes artificially offset by underestimation of van der Waals interactions by density functional theory. Our recommended energy decomposition analysis is a composite approach, in which cDFT is used to define the CT component of the interaction energy and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) defines the electrostatic, polarization, Pauli repulsion, and van der Waals contributions. SAPT/cDFT provides a stable and physically motivated energy decomposition that, when combined with a new implementation of open-shell SAPT, can be applied to supramolecular complexes involving molecules, ions, and/or radicals.},

abstract = {The first purely density-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) for intermolecular binding is developed within the density functional theory. The most important feature of this scheme is to variationally determine the frozen density energy, based on a constrained search formalism and implemented with the Wu-Yang algorithm [Q. Wu and W. Yang, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 2498 (2003)]. This variational process dispenses with the Heitler-London antisymmetrization of wave functions used in most previous methods and calculates the electrostatic and Pauli repulsion energies together without any distortion of the frozen density, an important fact that enables a clean separation of these two terms from the relaxation (i.e., polarization and charge transfer) terms. The new EDA also employs the constrained density functional theory approach [Q. Wu and T. Van Voorhis, Phys. Rev. A 72, 24502 (2005)] to separate out charge transfer effects. Because the charge transfer energy is based on the density flow in real space, it has a small basis set dependence. Applications of this decomposition to hydrogen bonding in the water dimer and the formamide dimer show that the frozen density energy dominates the binding in these systems, consistent with the noncovalent nature of the interactions. A more detailed examination reveals how the interplay of electrostatics and the Pauli repulsion determines the distance and angular dependence of these hydrogen bonds.},

abstract = {As a new type of noncovalent interactions, pnicogen bond between a VA group element (N, P, and As) and an electron donor (Lewis base) has grabbed attention in recent several years. Here we employ the block-localized wave function (BLW) based energy decomposition scheme to probe the bonding nature in a series of substituted phosphines X(n)PH(3-n) complexed with ammonia. As the BLW method can derive the optimal monomer orbitals in a complex with the electron transfer among monomers quenched, we can effectively examine the HOMO-LUMO interaction in these pnicogen bonding systems. Among various energy components, electron transfer energy together with the polarization energy dominates the pnicogen bonding energy. Although usually it is assumed that the electron transfer from ammonia to substituted phosphines occurs in the form of n → $\sigma$*(XP) hyperconjugative interaction, we identify a kind of new pathway when X = NO2 and CN, i.e., n → d$\pi$*, which results from the interaction between the $\pi$ orbital of cyano or nitro substituent and d orbitals on P. But still this picture of electron transfer using a single pair of orbitals is greatly simplified, as the electron density difference (EDD) maps corresponding to the overall electron transfer processes show the accumulation of electron density on the P side opposite to the X-P bond, with insignificant or even negligible gain of electron density on the substituent group side. Thus, the EDD maps tend to support the concept of $\sigma$-hole in pnicogen bonds.},

abstract = {Gas-phase electron diffraction experiments show that the C-N bond in aniline (1.407 {\AA}) is significantly shorter than in nitrobenzene (1.486 {\AA}). It is known that the amino group is electron-donating and the nitro group is electron-withdrawing, and both substitution groups can effectively conjugate with benzene. Thus, it is puzzling why the C-N bond in nitrobenzene is even longer than the single C-N bond in methylamine (1.472 {\AA}). In this work, we performed computations by strictly localizing the $\pi$ electrons with the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which is a variant of ab initio valence bond theory. Geometry optimizations of electron-localized states, where the conjugation over the C-N bond is quenched, show that the conjugation in nitrobenzene is only half of the conjugation in aniline. But even in optimal electron-localized states, the C-N bond in nitrobenzene is still 0.074 {\AA} longer than in aniline. As a consequence, it is indeed not the $\pi$ conjugation which is responsible for the disparity of the C-N bond distances in these systems. Instead, we demonstrated that the $\pi$-$\pi$ repulsion, which is contributed by both Pauli exchange and electrostatic interaction, plays the key role in this “abnormal” behavior. Notably, the $\pi$ resonance within the nitro group generates a considerable dipole, which repels the $\pi$ electrons in the benzene ring. The deactivation of the resonance within the nitro group significantly shortens the C-N bond by 0.06 {\AA}. The unfavorable $\pi$-$\pi$ electrostatic repulsion is further exemplified by N2O4. In fact, the destabilizing $\pi$-$\pi$ repulsion is ubiquitous but largely neglected in conjugated systems where only the stabilizing conjugation is the focus. Experimental phenomena such as the C-N bond distances in aniline and nitrobenzene result from the balance of both stabilizing and destabilizing forces.},

The electronic structure is treated by a new approach, ALMO-CIS+CT, which is a formulation of configuration interaction singles (CIS) based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs). The method generalizes the previously reported ALMO-CIS model [K. D. Closser et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 5791 (2015)] to include spatially localized charge transfer (CT) effects. It is designed to recover large numbers of excited states in atomic and molecular clusters, such as the entire n = 2 Rydberg band in helium clusters. ALMO-CIS+CT is shown to recover most of the error caused by neglecting charge transfer in ALMO-CIS and has comparable accuracy to standard CIS for helium clusters. For the n = 2 band, CT stabilizes states towards the blue edge by up to 0.5 eV. ALMO-CIS+CT retains the formal cubic scaling of ALMO-CIS with respect to syst...},
