abstract = {We apply tensor methods to formulate theories of electron correlation in nonorthogonal basis sets, The resulting equations are manifestly invariant to nonorthogonal basis transformations, between functions spanning either the occupied or virtual subspaces of the one-particle Hilbert space. The tensor approach is readily employed in either first or second quantization, As examples, second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, and coupled cluster theory with single and double substitutions, including noniterative triples, are recast using the tensor formalism. This gives equations which are invariant to larger classes of transformations than existing expressions. Procedures for truncating these equations are discussed.

@article{Schirmer1982,
abstract = {Within the framework of the many-body Green's-function method we present a new approach to the polarization propagator for finite Fermi systems. This approach makes explicit use of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion for the polarization propagator, and reformulates the exact summation in terms of a simple algebraic scheme, referred to as the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC). The ADC defines in a natural way a set of approximation schemes (nth-order ADC schemes) which represent infinite partial summations exact up to nth order of perturbation theory. In contrast to the randomphase- approximation (RPA)-like schemes, the corresponding mathematical procedures are essentially Hermitian eigenvalue problems in limited configuration spaces of unperturbed excited configurations. Explicit equations for the first- and second-order ADC schemes are derived. These schemes are thoroughly discussed and compared with the Tamm- Dancoff approximation and RPA schemes.},

@article{Harbach2014,
abstract = {The implementation of an efficient program of the algebraic diagrammatic construction method for the polarisation propagator in third-order perturbation theory (ADC(3)) for the computation of excited states is reported. The accuracies of ADC(2) and ADC(3) schemes have been investigated with respect to Thiel's recently established benchmark set for excitation energies and oscillator strengths. The calculation of 141 vertical excited singlet and 71 triplet states of 28 small to medium-sized organic molecules has revealed that ADC(3) exhibits mean error and standard deviation of 0.12 ± 0.28 eV for singlet states and -0.18 ± 0.16 eV for triplet states when the provided theoretical best estimates are used as benchmark. Accordingly, the ADC(2)-s and ADC(2)-x calculations revealed accuracies of 0.22 ± 0.38 eV and -0.70 ± 0.37 eV for singlets and 0.12 ± 0.16 eV and -0.55 ± 0.20 eV for triplets, respectively. For a comparison of CC3 and ADC(3), only non-CC3 benchmark values were considered, which comprise 84 singlet states and 19 triplet states. For these singlet states CC3 exhibits an accuracy of 0.23 ± 0.21 eV and ADC(3) an accuracy of 0.08 ± 0.27 eV, and accordingly for the triplet states of 0.12 ± 0.10 eV and -0.10 ± 0.13 eV, respectively. Hence, based on the quality of the existing benchmark set it is practically not possible to judge whether ADC(3) or CC3 is more accurate, however, ADC(3) has a much larger range of applicability due to its more favourable scaling of O(N(6)) with system size.},

@article{Hollman2014,
abstract = {A local density fitting scheme is considered in which atomic orbital (AO) products are approximated using only auxiliary AOs located on one of the nuclei in that product. The possibility of variational collapse to an unphysical "attractive electron" state that can affect such density fitting [P. Merlot, T. Kj{\ae}rgaard, T. Helgaker, R. Lindh, F. Aquilante, S. Reine, and T. B. Pedersen, J. Comput. Chem. 34, 1486 (2013)] is alleviated by including atom-wise semidiagonal integrals exactly. Our approach leads to a significant decrease in the computational cost of density fitting for Hartree-Fock theory while still producing results with errors 2-5 times smaller than standard, nonlocal density fitting. Our method allows for large Hartree-Fock and density functional theory computations with exact exchange to be carried out efficiently on large molecules, which we demonstrate by benchmarking our method on 200 of the most widely used prescription drug molecules. Our new fitting scheme leads to smooth and artifact-free potential energy surfaces and the possibility of relatively simple analytic gradients.},
