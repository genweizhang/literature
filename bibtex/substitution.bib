Taking the experimental pK(a)s of substituted anilines as a representative physicochemical property, five ab initio quantum chemical indices are compared for effectiveness as one-parameter regression descriptors for pK(a). All of the tested descriptors performed well for a set of 19 mono-, 13 di-, and 4 trisubstituted anilines, and two performed somewhat better than the traditional Hammett sigma constants. Among the calculated quantities, the best representation of the aniline pK(a)s is produced by the minimum average local ionization energy on the molecular surface.},

It is a conventionally used electronic parameter in studies of enzymatic quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). However, it is not necessarily obvious why ?? represents variations in the free-energy change associated with the complex formation between a congeneric series of ligands with their target protein. So far, several powerful molecular calculations, such as the ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) one, that are directly applicable to ligand-protein complexes have emerged. In this study, we comprehensively reevaluate experimentally derived parameter ?? confirming it represents intermolecular interaction energy terms, by applying molecular orbital (MO) calculations to a simple ligand-protein complex model. The current results provide a rational and quantitative basis for bridging the gap between the traditional QSAR approach and 'the modern QSAR one', which involves the molecular calculations to evaluate the overall free-energy change for complex formation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Theoretical computations to assess the influence of water solvent using the SCIPCM method showed that the solvent enhances the overall effect of polar substituents by about 30{\%}.

abstract = {A stopped-flow kinetic study shows that the reduction rate of horseradish peroxidase compound I by phenols and aromatic amines is greatly dependent upon the substituent effect on the benzene ring. Moreover it has been possible to relate the reduction rate constants with the ionization constants of monosubstituted substrates by a linear free-energy relationship (Hammett equation). The correlation of log (rate constants) with (r values (Hammett equation) and the absence of correlation with C T ' values (Okamoto-Brown equation) can be explained by a mechanism of aromatic substrate oxidations, in which the substrate gives an electron to the enzyme compound I and simultaneously loses a proton. The analogy which has been made with oxidation potentials of phenols or anilines strengthens the view that the reaction is only dependent on the relative ease of oxidation of the substrate. The rate constant obtained forp-aminophenol indicates that a value of 2.3 x 10' M-' s-' probably approaches the diffusion-controlled limit for a bimolecular reaction involving compound I and an aromatic substrate. One-electron oxidation of organic substrates (AH2) catalyzed by peroxidase is ususally depicted by the following well-known mechanism [l -31 (1) (2) authors have advanced the hypothesis that the phen-oxy radical formation occurs independently of the molecular sizes of phenols, but is dependent on their redox potentials. Substituent effects in aromatic molecules upon rates of reaction and equilibrium constants are generally interpreted by using the Eqn (4), known as E + H202 E-I E-I + AH2 A E-11 + AH .

Phenols [4,4a] and aromatic amines [5] are known to react via such a mechanism, and the pH profiles of compound I reduction rate constants show almost the same behavior for these two kinds of substrates. pH-independent values for k2 are obtained for pH values between 6 and 9. Shiga and Imaizumi [6] using an electron spin resonance flow technique have detected phenoxy radical formation from various substituted phenols during the H202 oxidation catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase.

Apart from aromatic stabilization energies the other descriptors of aromaticity vary to a very small extent, indicating high resistance of the pi-electron structure to the substituent effect.
