The products are typically isolated in good yields, even in the case of sensitive, $\alpha$-iodo-$\alpha$,$\alpha$-difluoromethyl ketones.

Within this review, the dramatic changes (and growth in size and diversity) that the field has undergone, particularly over the last 50 years, will also be discussed. Then finally, where fluorine chemistry is and where it appears to be going will be briefly discussed. The future of fluorine chemistry indeed appears bright, with fluorine chemistry set to play a role, and usually a significant role in most important areas of technology of the 21st century. New perspectives will be required, but then, fluorine chemists have been providing such "new perspectives" to this ever-changing field for the last 75 years. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Organofluorine affects nearly all physical and adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of a lead compound. Its inductive effects are relatively well understood, enhancing bioavailability, for example, by reducing the basicity of neighboring amines. In contrast, exploration of the specific influence of carbon-fluorine single bonds on docking interactions, whether through direct contact with the protein or through stereoelectronic effects on molecular conformation of the drug, has only recently begun. Here, we review experimental progress in this vein and add complementary analysis based on comprehensive searches in the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank.},

@article{Zafrani2017,
abstract = {There is a growing interest in organic compounds containing the difluoromethyl group, as it is considered a lipophilic hydrogen bond donor that may act as a bioisostere of hydroxyl, thiol, or amine groups. A series of difluoromethyl anisoles and thioanisoles was prepared and their druglike properties, hydrogen bonding, and lipophilicity were studied. The hydrogen bond acidity parameters A (0.085–0.126) were determined using Abraham's solute 1H NMR analysis. It was found that the difluoromethyl group acts as a hydrogen bond donor on a scale similar to that of thiophenol, aniline, and amine groups but not as that of hydroxyl. Although difluoromethyl is considered a lipophilicity enhancing group, the range of the experimental $\Delta$log P(water–octanol) values (log P(XCF2H) – log P(XCH3)) spanned from −0.1 to +0.4. For both parameters, a linear correlation was found between the measured values and Hammett $\sigma$ constants. These results may aid in the rational design of drugs containing the difluoromethyl moiety.},

We report a straightforward method for the cross-coupling of aryl and vinyl iodides with a difluoromethyl group generated from readily available reagents to form difluoromethylarenes and difluoromethyl-substituted alkenes. The reaction of electron-neutral, electron-rich, and sterically hindered aryl and vinyl iodides with the combination of CuI, CsF and TMSCF(2)H leads to the formation of difluoromethyl-substituted products in high yield with good functional group compatibility. This transformation is surprising, in part, because of the prior observation of the instability of CuCF(2)H.},
