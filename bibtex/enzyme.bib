abstract = {Mercuric reductase, MerA, is a key enzyme in bacterial mercury resistance. This homodimeric enzyme captures and reduces toxic Hg(2+) to Hg(0), which is relatively unreactive and can exit the cell passively. Prior to reduction, the Hg(2+) is transferred from a pair of cysteines (C558' and C559' using Tn501 numbering) at the C-terminus of one monomer to another pair of cysteines (C136 and C141) in the catalytic site of the other monomer. Here, we present the X-ray structure of the C-terminal Hg(2+) complex of the C136A/C141A double mutant of the Tn501 MerA catalytic core and explore the molecular mechanism of this Hg transfer with quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations. The transfer is found to be nearly thermoneutral and to pass through a stable tricoordinated intermediate that is marginally less stable than the two end states. For the overall process, Hg(2+) is always paired with at least two thiolates and thus is present at both the C-terminal and catalytic binding sites as a neutral complex. Prior to Hg(2+) transfer, C141 is negatively charged. As Hg(2+) is transferred into the catalytic site, a proton is transferred from C136 to C559' while C558' becomes negatively charged, resulting in the net transfer of a negative charge over a distance of ∼7.5 {\AA}. Thus, the transport of this soft divalent cation is made energetically feasible by pairing a competition between multiple Cys thiols and/or thiolates for Hg(2+) with a competition between the Hg(2+) and protons for the thiolates.},

abstract = {Conditions are described under which the nonphysiological substrate mercuric bromide (HgBr2) is rapidly turned over, both by the wild type (CCCC) and by an active site double mutant (CCAA) of mercuric reductase in which the C-terminal cysteines 557' and 558' are replaced by alanine and only the redox-active pair Cys135 and Cys140 are available for catalysis. A maximum rate of turnover kcatapp of approximately 18 s-1 (at 3 degreesC) for both enzymes is observed, and at high [HgBr2]/[enzyme] ratios, inhibition is found. The UV-vis spectral changes during turnover are closely similar in both enzymes, indicating that catalysis follows the same enzymatic mechanism. Single-turnover analysis of the mutant enzyme shows that after binding of HgBr2, two further rapid events ensue, followed by reduction of the metal ion (kobs approximately 23.5 s-1). It is shown that under multiple-turnover conditions, completion of the catalytic cycle must occur via an ordered mechanism where rapid binding of a new molecule of HgBr2 to EH2.NADP+ precedes exchange of the pyridine nucleotide. Binding of HgBr2 to the active site triple mutant C135A/C557A/C558A (ACAA) is ca. 100-fold slower compared to that of the CCAA mutant and results in no detectable turnover. It is concluded that in the reducible enzyme.Hg(II) complex, the metal ion is coordinated to Cys135 and Cys140 and that for efficient catalysis both residues are required. Furthermore, the data imply that binding to EH2.NADPH occurs via initial rate-limiting attack of Cys135, followed by reaction with Cys140.},

abstract = {Wild-type mercuric ion reductase (CCCC enzyme) possesses four cysteines in each of its Hg(II) binding sites, a redox-active pair and a C-terminal pair. Mutation of the C-terminal cysteines to alanines (CCAA enzyme) leads to a loss of steady-state mercuric ion reductase activity using Hg(SR)2 substrates. However, CCCC and CCAA enzymes exhibit an equally high rate of binding and turnover using HgBr2 as substrate under pre-steady-state conditions [Engst and Miller (1998) Biochemistry 37, 11496-11507.]. Since the ligands in these HgX2 substrates differ both in size and in affinity for Hg(II), one or both of these properties may contribute to their different reactivities with CCAA enzyme. To further explore the importance of these two properties, we have examined the pre-steady-state reactions of CCCC and CCAA with Hg(CN)2, which has small, high-affinity ligands, and with Hg(Cys)2, which has bulky, high-affinity ligands. The results indicate that HgX2 substrates with small ligands can rapidly access the redox-active cysteines in the absence of the C-terminal cysteines, but those with large ligands require the C-terminal cysteines for rapid access. In addition, it is concluded that the C-terminal cysteines play a critical role in removing the high-affinity ligands before Hg(II) reaches the redox-active cysteines in the inner active site, since direct access of HgX2 substrates with high-affinity ligands leads to formation of an inhibited complex. Consistent with the results, both a narrow channel leading directly to the redox-active cysteines and a wider channel leading to the redox-active cysteines via initial contact with the C-terminal cysteines can be identified in the structure of the enzyme from Bacillus sp.

@article{Parks2016,
abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element that is released into the biosphere both by natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Although its reduced, elemental form Hg(0) is relatively nontoxic, other forms such as Hg(2+) and, in particular, its methylated form, methylmercury, are toxic, with deleterious effects on both ecosystems and humans. Microorganisms play important roles in the transformation of mercury in the environment. Inorganic Hg(2+) can be methylated by certain bacteria and archaea to form methylmercury. Conversely, bacteria also demethylate methylmercury and reduce Hg(2+) to relatively inert Hg(0). Transformations and toxicity occur as a result of mercury interacting with various proteins. Clearly, then, understanding the toxic effects of mercury and its cycling in the environment requires characterization of these interactions. Computational approaches are ideally suited to studies of mercury in proteins because they can provide a detailed molecular picture and circumvent issues associated with toxicity. Here, we describe computational methods for investigating and characterizing how mercury binds to proteins, how inter- and intraprotein transfer of mercury is orchestrated in biological systems, and how chemical reactions in proteins transform the metal. We describe quantum chemical analyses of aqueous Hg(II), which reveal critical factors that determine ligand-binding propensities. We then provide a perspective on how we used chemical reasoning to discover how microorganisms methylate mercury. We also highlight our combined computational and experimental studies of the proteins and enzymes of the mer operon, a suite of genes that confer mercury resistance in many bacteria. Lastly, we place work on mercury in proteins in the context of what is needed for a comprehensive multiscale model of environmental mercury cycling.},

abstract = {We use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to study the cleavage of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) backbone catalyzed by ribonuclease H. This protein is a prototypical member of a large family of enzymes that use two-metal catalysis to process nucleic acids. By combining Hamiltonian replica exchange with a finite-temperature string method, we calculate the free energy surface underlying the RNA-cleavage reaction and characterize its mechanism. We find that the reaction proceeds in two steps. In a first step, catalyzed primarily by magnesium ion A and its ligands, a water molecule attacks the scissile phosphate. Consistent with thiol-substitution experiments, a water proton is transferred to the downstream phosphate group. The transient phosphorane formed as a result of this nucleophilic attack decays by breaking the bond between the phosphate and the ribose oxygen. In the resulting intermediate, the dissociated but unprotonated leaving group forms an alkoxide coordinated to magnesium ion B. In a second step, the reaction is completed by protonation of the leaving group, with a neutral Asp132 as a likely proton donor. The overall reaction barrier of ∼15 kcal mol(-1), encountered in the first step, together with the cost of protonating Asp132, is consistent with the slow measured rate of ∼1-100/min. The two-step mechanism is also consistent with the bell-shaped pH dependence of the reaction rate. The nonmonotonic relative motion of the magnesium ions along the reaction pathway agrees with X-ray crystal structures. Proton-transfer reactions and changes in the metal ion coordination emerge as central factors in the RNA-cleavage reaction.},

abstract = {The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme catalyzes a self-cleavage reaction using a combination of nucleobase and metal ion catalysis. Both divalent and monovalent ions can catalyze this reaction, although the rate is slower with monovalent ions alone. Herein, we use quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations to investigate the mechanism of this ribozyme and to elucidate the roles of the catalytic metal ion. With Mg(2+) at the catalytic site, the self-cleavage mechanism is observed to be concerted with a phosphorane-like transition state and a free energy barrier of ∼13 kcal/mol, consistent with free energy barrier values extrapolated from experimental studies. With Na(+) at the catalytic site, the mechanism is observed to be sequential, passing through a phosphorane intermediate, with free energy barriers of 2-4 kcal/mol for both steps; moreover, proton transfer from the exocyclic amine of protonated C75 to the nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate occurs to stabilize the phosphorane intermediate in the sequential mechanism. To explain the slower rate observed experimentally with monovalent ions, we hypothesize that the activation of the O2' nucleophile by deprotonation and orientation is less favorable with Na(+) ions than with Mg(2+) ions. To explore this hypothesis, we experimentally measure the pKa of O2' by kinetic and NMR methods and find it to be lower in the presence of divalent ions rather than only monovalent ions. The combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the catalytic Mg(2+) ion may play three key roles: assisting in the activation of the O2' nucleophile, acidifying the general acid C75, and stabilizing the nonbridging oxygen to prevent proton transfer to it.},

Here we follow the course of phosphodiester bond formation using time-resolved X-ray crystallography. Native human DNA polymerase $\eta$, DNA and dATP were co-crystallized at pH 6.0 without Mg(2+). The polymerization reaction was initiated by exposing crystals to 1 mM Mg(2+) at pH 7.0, and stopped by freezing at desired time points for structural analysis. The substrates and two Mg(2+) ions are aligned within 40 s, but the bond formation is not evident until 80 s. From 80 to 300 s structures show a mixture of decreasing substrate and increasing product of the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction. Transient electron densities indicate that deprotonation and an accompanying C2'-endo to C3'-endo conversion of the nucleophile 3'-OH are rate limiting. A third Mg(2+) ion, which arrives with the new bond and stabilizes the intermediate state, may be an unappreciated feature of the two-metal-ion mechanism.},

By combining in crystallo reaction and X-ray diffraction analysis of reaction intermediates, we have obtained unprecedented atomic details of the DNA synthesis process. Contrary to the established theory that enzyme-substrate complexes and transition states have identical atomic composition and catalysis occurs by the two-metal-ion mechanism, we have discovered that an additional divalent cation has to be captured en route to product formation. Unlike the canonical two metal ions, which are coordinated by DNA polymerases, this third metal ion is free of enzyme coordination. Its location between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phosphates of dNTP suggests that the third metal ion may drive the phosphoryltransfer from the leaving group opposite to the 3'-OH nucleophile. Experimental data indicate that binding of the third metal ion may be the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis and the free energy associated with the metal-ion binding can overcome the activation barrier to the DNA synthesis reaction.},
