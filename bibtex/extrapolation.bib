abstract = {We propose a density functional perturbative scheme to approximate the energy of a high-level DFT calculation at a significantly reduced cost. Our approach involves performing a primary SCF calculation using a crude functional, basis set and quadrature grid, followed by a single step using a more sophisticated secondary functional, basis and grid. Unlike the earlier dual-level DFT approach of Nakajima and Hirao, we use Roothaan diagonalization instead of perturbation theory to incorporate the effects of the secondary basis set. We show that energies at the popular B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p)/(75,302) level can be accurately estimated from primary calculations at the relatively economical BLYP/6-31G(d)/SG-0 level.},

@article{Steele2006a,
abstract = {Analytic gradients of dual-basis Hartree-Fock and density functional theory energies have been derived and implemented, which provide the opportunity for capturing large basis-set gradient effects at reduced cost. Suggested pairings for gradient calculations are 6-31G/6-31G**, dual[-f,-d]/cc-pVTZ, and 6-311G*/6-311 + +G(3df,3pd). Equilibrium geometries are produced within 0.0005 A of large-basis results for the latter two pairings. Though a single, iterative SCF response equation must be solved (unlike standard SCF gradients), it may be obtained in the smaller basis set, and integral screening further reduces the cost for well-chosen subsets. Total nuclear force calculations exhibit up to 75{\%} savings, relative to large-basis calculations.},

@article{Steele2006,
abstract = {The resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation has placed the onus of the cost of a second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) calculation on the underlying self-consistent field (SCF) calculation for many moderately sized molecules. A dual-basis approach to the SCF calculation, based on previous methods demonstrated for density functional theory, is combined with RI-MP2 calculations, and small basis subsets for cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and 6-311++G(3df,3pd) are presented. These subsets provide time savings of greater than 90{\%}, with negligible errors in absolute and relative energies, compared to the associated full-basis counterpart. The method is tested with a series of rotational barriers, relative conformational energies of alanine tetrapeptides, as well as the full G3/99 molecular set. RI-MP2 calculations on alanine octapeptides (40 heavy atoms, 3460 basis functions), using cc-pVQZ, are presented. Results improve upon previous methods that diagonalize the virtual space separately.},
