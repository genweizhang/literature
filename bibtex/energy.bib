abstract = {Three structurally identical polymers, except for the number of fluorine substitutions (0, 1, or 2) on the repeat unit (BnDT-DTBT), are investigated in detail, to further understand the impact of these fluorine atoms on open circuit voltage (V(oc)), short circuit current (J(sc)), and fill factor (FF) of related solar cells. While the enhanced V(oc) can be ascribed to a lower HOMO level of the polymer by adding more fluorine substituents, the improvement in J(sc) and FF are likely due to suppressed charge recombination. While the reduced bimolecular recombination with raising fluorine concentration is confirmed by variable light intensity studies, a plausibly suppressed geminate recombination is implied by the significantly increased change of dipole moment between the ground and excited states ($\Delta$$\mu$(ge)) for these polymers as the number of fluorine substituents increases. Moreover, the 2F polymer (PBnDT-DTffBT) exhibits significantly more scattering in the in-plane lamellar stacking and out-of-plane $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking directions, observed with GIWAXS. This indicates that the addition of fluorine leads to a more face-on polymer crystallite orientation with respect to the substrate, which could contribute to the suppressed charge recombination. R-SoXS also reveals that PBnDT-DTffBT has larger and purer polymer/fullerene domains. The higher domain purity is correlated with an observed decrease in PCBM miscibility in polymer, which drops from 21{\%} (PBnDT-DTBT) to 12{\%} (PBnDT-DTffBT). The disclosed "fluorine" impact not only explains the efficiency increase from 4{\%} of PBnDT-DTBT (0F) to 7{\%} with PBnDT-DTffBT (2F) but also suggests fluorine substitution should be generally considered in the future design of new polymers.},

abstract = {This paper describes synthesis and photovoltaic studies of a series of new semiconducting polymers with alternating thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzodithiophene units. The physical properties of these polymers were finely tuned to optimize their photovoltaic effect. The substitution of alkoxy side chains to the less electron-donating alkyl chains or introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine into the polymer backbone reduced the HOMO energy levels of polymers. The structural modifications optimized polymers? spectral coverage of absorption and their hole mobility, as well as miscibility with fulleride, and enhanced polymer solar cell performances. The open circuit voltage, Voc, for polymer solar cells was increased by adjusting polymer energy levels. It was found that films with finely distributed polymer/fulleride interpenetrating network exhibited improved solar cell conversion efficiency. Efficiency over 6{\%} has been achieved in simple solar cells based on fluorinated PTB4/PC61BM films prepared from mixed solvents. The results proved that polymer solar cells have a bright future.},

@article{Gomez-Bombarelli2016,
abstract = {Virtual screening is becoming a ground-breaking tool for molecular discovery due to the exponential growth of available computer time and constant improvement of simulation and machine learning techniques. We report an integrated organic functional material design process that incorporates theoretical insight, quantum chemistry, cheminformatics, machine learning, industrial expertise, organic synthesis, molecular characterization, device fabrication and optoelectronic testing. After exploring a search space of 1.6 million molecules and screening over 400,000 of them using time-dependent density functional theory, we identified thousands of promising novel organic light-emitting diode molecules across the visible spectrum. Our team collaboratively selected the best candidates from this set. The experimentally determined external quantum eeciencies for these synthesized candidates were as large as 22{\%}. T he availability of unprecedented computational resources and novel algorithms is opening pathways to solve problems that were previously intractable due to their large scale. For this reason, computational tools can become a disruptive instrument for molecular discovery. Chemical space is infinite for practical purposes 1 , but many important and desirable properties of materials are predictable from simulation. However, computers alone cannot meet this challenge, no matter how powerful. It is only with experimental guidance and collaboration that a computer-driven approach becomes a natural fit for this task. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) combines quantum chemical calculations and cheminformatics methods to search molecular space for leads 2–4 . Advised by computational predictions, experimental efforts are focused on only the most promising molecular candidates. Recent applications of this approach include screening for both inorganic 5,6 and organic materials in application areas such as electrolytes for flow batteries 7,8 and photovoltaics 9–11 . However, it is not often that HTVS predictions are confirmed experimentally, due to factors such as access to experimental partners, synthetic difficulty, poor predictive power, and instability of candidate molecules. The emissive layers of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices are made from electroluminescent molecules. Because of their high efficiency and superior colour properties, OLEDs have wide application in small displays and the OLED technology has the potential to become an attractive solution for larger displays such as televisions, flexible displays, or lighting applications. Traditional fluorescent emitters rely on the quantum-mechanically allowed singlet–singlet transition, and therefore can harvest only one quarter of the electron–hole recombination pairs formed in the device. Current phosphorescent OLED technology leverages spin–orbit coupling due to heavy atoms 12 , most often iridium. This makes the triplet state emissive, and also harvests the singlet excitons through these emissive triplets 13 . However, iridium is one of the least abundant elements, and thus phosphorescent OLEDs face high materials cost. Additionally, OLEDs face challenges in efficiency and stability. In particular, deep-blue emitters magnify these problems due to the large amount of energy stored in the excited state, around 3 eV. The promises and challenges of OLED technology and materials have sparked significant research interest, as detailed in recent reviews 14,15 . One particularly promising approach to circumvent the high cost of phosphorescent OLED materials is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) 16–18 . In TADF, non-emissive triplet states are harvested via thermal fluctuations that repopulate the emissive singlet state through a process known as reverse intersystem},

@article{Jinadasa2015,
abstract = {The synthesis of a series of beta-functionalized push-pull dibenzoporphyrins was realized. These porphyrins display subtle push-pull effects, demonstrating the exceptional tunability of their electronic and electrochemical properties. The UV-vis spectra of these porphyrins show unique absorption patterns with shouldered Soret bands and extra absorptions in the Q-band region. Stronger electron-withdrawing groups display more significant bathochromic shifts of the Soret bands. The fluorescence spectra of these porphyrins show strong near-IR emission bands (600-850 nm). In particular, fluorescence quenching effect was observed for pyridyl carrying push-pull porphyrin 4c in the presence of an acid. TFA titration study of 4c using UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy reveals that the fluorescence quenching can be mainly attributed to the protonation of the pyridyl groups of 4c. The versatile synthetic methods developed in this work may open a door to access a large number of functionalized organic materials that are currently unavailable. The structure-property studies provided in this work may provide useful guidelines for the design of new generations of materials in dye-sensitized solar cells, in nonlinear optical applications, as fluorescence probes, as well as sensitizers for photodynamic therapy.},

The substituent effects on the molecular orbital energy levels of the porphyrin derivatives have been discussed and promising donor-acceptor combinations are screened. Several novel zinc metalloporphyrins selected were then calculated by means of the DFT/TDDFT method in THF solvent. The electronic and spectroscopic properties of ZnTPP and the selected novel zinc porphyrin complexes have been investigated as solar cell sensitizers. The results show that the candidates selected are very promising to provide good performances as sensitizers, in which ZnTPPG is promising to challenge the current photo-electric conversion efficiency record 7.1{\%} of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells. The concepts of attribute axis and attribute coordinate system are shown very helpful for tuning the molecular properties and the rational design of functional molecules with anticipated good properties.},
