@article{Petraglia2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Organic electronic materials remarkably illustrate the importance of the "weak" dispersion interactions that are neglected in the most cost-efficient electronic structure approaches. This work introduces a fast atom-pairwise dispersion correction, dDMC that is compatible with the most recent variant of self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB). The emphasis is placed on improving the description of $\pi$-$\pi$ stacked motifs featuring sulfur-containing molecules that are known to be especially challenging for DFTB. Our scheme relies upon the use of Mulliken charges using minimal basis set that are readily available from the DFTB computations at no additional cost. The performance and efficiency of the dDMC correction are validated on examples targeting energies, geometries, and molecular dynamic trajectories.},

@article{Slipchenko2017,
abstract = {The importance of dispersion forces in water clusters is examined using the effective fragment potential (EFP) method. Since the original EFP1 water potential does not include dispersion, a dispersion correction to the EFP1 potential (EFP1-D) was derived and implemented. The addition of dispersion to the EFP1 potential yields improved geometries for water clusters that contain 2-6 molecules. The importance of the odd E7 contribution to the dispersion energy is investigated. The E7 dispersion term is repulsive for all of the water clusters studied here and can have a magnitude that is as large as half of the E6 value. The E7 term therefore contributes to larger intermolecular distances for the optimized geometries. Inclusion of many-body effects and/or higher order terms may be necessary to further improve dispersion energies and optimized geometries.},
